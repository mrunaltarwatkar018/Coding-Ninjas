/*
        Has Path

        Problem statement: Given an undirected graph G(V, E) and two vertices v1 and
        v2(as integers), check if there exists any path between them or not. Print true or
        false. V is the number of vertices present in graph G, and vertices are numbered
        from 0 to V-1. E is the number of edges present in graph G.

        Approach: This can be simply solved by considering the vertex v1 as starting vertex
        and then run either BFS or DFS as per your choice, and while traversing if we reach
        the vertex v2, then we will simply return true, otherwise return false.

        This problem has been left for you to try yourself. For code, refer to the solution tab
        of the same.
