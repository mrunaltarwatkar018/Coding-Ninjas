        Backtracking :

                            Backtracing is an approach of exploring all the paths and
                            it is implemented recursively.

                            Approach :

                                    1)  Place yourself at start point
                                    2)  Explore all the paths possible from that starting point
                                    3)  Insert your element at only correct possible positions and 
                                        once inserted Move onto smaller problem.
                                        (Insert at all possible positions)
                                    4)  Once you reach base case, print your solution. 
                                    5)  Once you explore all paths from one point,
                                        backtrack to your previous point.
