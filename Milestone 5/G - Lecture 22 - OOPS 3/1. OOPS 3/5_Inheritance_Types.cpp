Inheritance: Types

        There are six types of inheritance:

                ●   Single Inheritance: ​Here, a child class is created from a single 
                    parent class.


                ●   Multi-level Inheritance: ​Here, there is a series of derived classes, 
                    which means a derived class is created from another derived class.


                ●   Multi-level Inheritance: ​Here, there is a series of derived classes, 
                    which means a derived class is created from another derived class.


                ●   Multipath Inheritance: ​In this type of inheritance, a derived class 
                    is created from other derived classes and the same base class of 
                    other derived classes.


                ●   Hierarchical Inheritance: ​Here, ​more than one derived classes are 
                    created from a single base class, and further, child classes act as 
                    parent classes for more than one child class.

                    
                ●   Hybrid Inheritance: ​It is the combination of more than one inheritances. 
                    It is also known as ​Diamond inheritance​.
