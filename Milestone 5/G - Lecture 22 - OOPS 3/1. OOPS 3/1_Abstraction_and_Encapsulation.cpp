        Object-Oriented Programming generally contains the following four 
        concepts:
                        ●   Abstraction
                        ●   Encapsulation
                        ●   Inheritance
                        ●   Polymorphism
        Let’s study these in detail in other sections.

        Abstraction & Encapsulation

                You are travelling in a car and suddenly, you have to make it stop. 
                For that, you will be applying the brake. This whole system is 
                enclosed inside the car’s body. This process is known as encapsulation. 
                To stop the car, you just have to apply the brake without thinking of 
                the internal functioning of the car’s engine system. 

                Encapsulation ​refers to combining data along with the methods operating 
                on that data  into a single unit called class. It also refers to the 
                mechanism of binding the direct access state values for all the 
                variables of the particular object. The main reason for using 
                encapsulation is to provide security to the data of the class.

        Reasons for which encapsulation is considered are:
                ●   Functionality is defined at a logical place and not at multiple 
                    locations.
                ●   It prevents our data from being modified from any external 
                    influence.

        Abstraction ​means providing only some part of the information to the user by
        hiding the internal implementation details of it. We just need to know about the
        methods of the objects that we need to call and the input parameters needed to
        trigger a specific operation excluding the details of implementation and type of
        action performed to get the result.

        Reasons for using abstraction are:
                ●   It allows us to group different related units(classes) as siblings.
                ●   It helps in the reduction of design and implementation complexity.
